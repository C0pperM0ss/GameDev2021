input/output:
https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/javascript/how-to-manage-text-input-and-output-with-javascript-for-html5-and-css3-programming/
input output is best described as you type in your name into a box and the code spits out a hard coded line like "hi, *your name*"
variables:
https://javascript.info/variables
varaibles in javascript are just like in math but a bit different. We have let and var as two sytaxes for starting a variable.
Ex.
let message = "hello";
alert(message);
(you can also use var)
you can also make it a bit more complicated by doubling up the weird
let message = "hi";
var hello = message; //copy of message but w/ different name
alert(message)
loops:
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp
loops are loops they constantly play the same code over and over again
Ex.
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
} //not mine but it lets you visualise how it is created and how it is utilised, so you wont have to repeat yourself over and over.
