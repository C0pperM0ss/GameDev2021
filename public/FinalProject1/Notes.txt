index page will be the start menu and that is where you will select your difficulty setting for the game. once you select a dificulty setting a button will show up that says "start" 
once pressed the start button will take you to your respective page for your level and the game will start
blocks in random order will drop down and will line up with a certain area.
i will have to make a stop function and a function that removes or moves down all the objects in the scene to remove them from the main play area.
i will use images the have been cut out for each and every object
ways of making this
create a canvas option that creates them as each block is a function turning it into a bit of a comlicated bunch but it will e the simplest way. make each object an imgae and thern delete those parts of the images when they are all grouped up
